How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  While writing the code, we need to make sure it adds the functionality to the code consistently without error. This will helps building a program without redoing it again and again. Readable code means to follow the logical order while writing the code and adding comments where needed. This helps other people to understand the code. Adaptibility means if the code is modular and you have it set so that each function is used to do one thing and that function is adapted for any other data type.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  As a computer scientist, I would look at the problem by looking at its output, and the output that will help me to reach there. I would build the lower level tools first and build the code using those low level functions. This is being my first project using the database by creating CRUD module.
  
  What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  
    Computer scientists develops the software that can be used by anyone. by making this software, they make everyones job easy. Without computer scientist, it would be tough to do simple things like adding up the number of employees for various companies, number of patients in the hospital, or there will be no existence of the video games or animated films.
